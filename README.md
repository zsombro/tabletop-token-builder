# Tabletop token builder

Create neat tokens for virtual tabletop tools like Roll20

Just find an image on the web, right click it, press "Copy image" and then press Ctrl+V/Cmd+V in the app.

If you're a GM preparing to run a game, you can create multiple tokens using the same settings by simply repeatedly pasting images and saving them.
